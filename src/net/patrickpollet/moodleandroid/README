/**
 * this is a very basic android application using my moodlews_ksoap.jar package
 * and the standard ksoap2-android-assembly-2.5.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar

 * 
 * you must copy this source code into the main application of a new Android project that has in its classpath
 * the two jar cited above 
 * 
 *  * Nothing is displayed in the emulator screen (except an hello world...) 
 * all results are logged into the Android log file that can be seen in the DDMS view of Eclipse running Android SDK
 * 
 * this version used the old WSDL implementation available in net.patrickpollet.moodlewsold.core.*
